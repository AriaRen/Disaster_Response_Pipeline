## installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in predicting message categories during disaster. While a disaster happens, people claim multiple needs in different aspects, which should be responsed from different US departments. Developing an app to help get exact category is important. There would be much interesting practice including text cleaning, machine learning and web development. 

## File Description
There are 3 python files available here to showcase work related to data transformation, data modeling and app development. The python scripts include data and package loading, data cleaning, transformation, model building and app development. 

## Results
The main findings, which is the web app can be found by running python scripts.
